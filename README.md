# Counter-Javascript
Counter effect with Javascript, parallax effect and typewriter effect.

I created a numerical counter with Javascript through the 'On click' event of the two buttons, to which I gave some CSS3 effects.
Within the project there are also other Javascript functions such as the tiperwriter for writing the title, and the parallax movement of the Counter through the 'mousemove' event.
Finally, I correctly resized the display via tablet and mobile with the 'Media Query'.
